       <h2>History and Origins</h2>
       <p>Leamington Spa was originally a small village called Leamington Priors, which was located south of the River Leam.
    The spa waters were known by the Romans but were rediscovered in 1784 by William Abbotts and Benjamin Satchwell.
    They commercialized the spa waters, which brought a lot of tourism to the area.
    With tourism, came the expansion of the town, north of the River Leam, and with increasing numbers flocking to the town,
    the existing bathhouses could no longer cope.
    Therefore, in 1814, the Royal Rump Rooms and Baths were opened.
    The town was now popular and thriving, attracting the wealthy and famous. Numerous Georgian townhouses were built to
    accommodate these people.
    Between the years of 1808 and 1834, sections of the Parade were developed, along with the Regent Hotel, a town hall, and
    the Jephson Gardens.
    In 1838, Queen Victoria granted the town a Royal Prefix and Leamington Priors was renamed Royal Leamington Spa.
    Queen Victoria visited as a princess in 1830 and as Queen in 1838.
    In 1840 the Victoria Bridge was opened, connecting the old and new towns.
    The town saw rapid growth. Between 1801 and 1851, the town grew from a population of 315 to 15,724.

             <h2>History and Origins</h2>
             <br>
             <p>Leamington Spa was originally a small village called Leamington Priors, which was located south of the River Leam.
                The spa waters were known by the Romans but were rediscovered in 1784 by William Abbotts and Benjamin Satchwell.
                They commercialized the spa waters, which brought a lot of tourism to the area.
                With tourism, came the expansion of the town, north of the River Leam, and with increasing numbers flocking to the town,
                the existing bathhouses could no longer cope.
                Therefore, in 1814, the Royal Rump Rooms and Baths were opened.
                The town was now popular and thriving, attracting the wealthy and famous. Numerous Georgian townhouses were built to
                accommodate these people.
                Between the years of 1808 and 1834, sections of the Parade were developed, along with the Regent Hotel, a town hall, and
                the Jephson Gardens.
                In 1838, Queen Victoria granted the town a Royal Prefix and Leamington Priors was renamed Royal Leamington Spa.
                Queen Victoria visited as a princess in 1830 and as Queen in 1838.
                In 1840 the Victoria Bridge was opened, connecting the old and new towns.
                The town saw rapid growth. Between 1801 and 1851, the town grew from a population of 315 to 15,724.

                <h2>Lawn Tennis</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first Lawn Tennis club in the world was opened in Leamington, Warwickshire in 1872 by Harry Gem, Augurio Perera,
                    Arthur Wellesley Tomkins, and Frederick Haynes. The club was located on Avenue Road, next to the Manor House Hotel.
                    The game was originally referred to as Lawn Rackets or Lawn Pelota, but by 1872, it had become known as Lawn Tennis.
                    This was five years before Wimbledon would hold its first championship.

                <h2>'Silicon Spa'</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Recently, Leamington has made a name for itself in the gaming industry. It has even been nicknamed 'Silicon Spa'. 
                    Various game development companies have set up offices in Leamington due to a vibrant community, good transport links
                    and a good proximity to talent pools and nearby universtities.
                    The list of companies is vast, and includes the likes of Ubisoft, Codemasters (who were founded in Leamington), 
                    Playground games, who developed the Forza Horizon series, and many more.

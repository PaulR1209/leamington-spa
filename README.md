# Leamington spa

This is a website about the town that I live in, called Leamington Spa. The purpose of the website is to give a brief history of the town, and to give a small insite into what is going on in the town today. My target audience varies from local people who want to know more about the town they live in, to people wanting to visit the town for the first time.

# Features

## Navigation Bar

Featured exactly the same on each page. Includes the logo and links to the Home Page, Gallery and Contact Us pages. This allows easy navigation across all pages.

This is also fully responsive to allow easy navigation across all sizes of screens. I have incorporated a hamburger menu for smaller screens, so that the Navigation bar is not too crowded. The vast majority of my code for the hamburger menu is from the Love Running project.
